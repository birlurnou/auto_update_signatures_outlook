# Automatic update of Outlook signature
Script for auto update signature on Outlook

**How the script works**

1. On the user's side, there will be a client part of the program that takes data from the database and generates signatures locally.

2. On the administration side, there will be an interface for working with signature data and a database.

**Plans**

* ~~Implement the .htm signature file generation process~~

* Implement a small user interface to control the stability of the user

* ~~Implement smart storage and replacement.htm files~~

*gui.py*

* Sketch out an interface template and think over the little things (locally in an excel file)
