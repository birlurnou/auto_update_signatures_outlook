# Automatic update of Outlook signature in a corporate environment
Script for auto update signature on Outlook in a corporate environment

**How the script works**

1. On the user's side, there will be a client part of the program that takes data from the database and generates signatures locally.

2. On the administration side, there will be an interface for working with signature data and a database.

**Plans**

*main.py*

* ~~Implement data retrieval from SQL~~

* ~~Implement the .htm signature file generation process~~

* ~~Implement smart storage and replacement.htm files~~

* ~~Implement adding a signature to the registry~~

* ~~Implement signature settings via a config file~~

* ~~Implement a small user interface to control the stability of the user~~

*gui.py*

* Sketch out an interface template and think over the little things (locally in an excel file)
